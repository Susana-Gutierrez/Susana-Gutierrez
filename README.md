## :woman: About Me

My name is Susana Gutierrez and Iâ€™m a full-stack web developer.  Coding has been an interest of mine throughout my life.  I recently decided to take my talents to the professional level and learn JavaScript and React.js to create effective web applications for businesses.

I created a web application for makeup lovers to search for and find high quality natural makeup products.  I also created an online game for people to have some fun competing with each other and relax.  These two applications combined my hobbies and culture with my continued growth as a web developer.  I hope you enjoy!
